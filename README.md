A set of templates and other assets designed to create a consistent, user-accessible, and naturalistic style for documents both physical and on the modern web.

## Features
- A earth toned, tetrad-based color scheme with text colors that meet [WCAG AAA guidelines](http://colorsafe.co/) when used on a #ffffff background.
- In Word templates, heavy use of the [Styles](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Customize-or-create-new-styles-d38d6e47-f6fc-48eb-a607-1eb120dec563) feature to ease common formatting and cross-system compatibility.
- Unique typography using [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web) families [Lato by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) (sans) and [PT Serif by Alexandra Korolkova and colleagues](https://old.paratype.com/public/) (serifs). 

## Word Templates

### Outline

![Outline](examples/outline.png)

A colorful outline format with APA-compatible numbering designed to support casual brainstorming.

### Tufte

![Tufte](examples/tufte.png)

A handout layout inspired by the practice of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com) relying on heavy use of side notes (due to Word limitations, side notes sit in text boxes - I recommend you copy/paste the example side note and format to your needs).
